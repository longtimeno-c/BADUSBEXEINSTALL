This is my BADUSB EXE installer 

This will install any exe file onto the machine you are acessing 

Disclaimer: I hold no responsibility for this scripts use.

To use this script replace the "url-keep quotation marks" with the desired download link. If you are using Dropbox which I recommend: 
Click 'share', 'copy link' and change the last digit (0) to a 1. This will allow it to automatically download.

Now replace the "C:\Windows\Temp\example.exe" with your desired file path (leaving in the " around it). 
You must include the correct exe file name! This will not work otherwise.
